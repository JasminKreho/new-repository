The idea is proof-of-concept of a scalable home automation system.
That system is affordable and available to all people.
Centralized approach means that "brain" of the system is Altera DE2i-150 board.
It is connected to home WiFi network through router.
Router acts as gateway to internet. 
Users can control home appliances from anywhere.

------------------------------------------------
The Idea of the project was to generate midi files using old floppy drives.
The prototype was made in 48 hours competition. 
The logic behind is that floppy drives contain stepper motors that produce high and low tones
when they move forward and backwards.
JAVA application reads and decomposes midi file.
Then it sends data to microcontroller via serial communication. 
According to data recieved, microcontroller controls the motors.
-----------------------------------
Project is based on desktop application with GUI that uses Microsoft SAPI.
It communicates with ATmega 2560 Microcontroller platform via serial communication.
It was a first prototype of larger Smart house project. User was able to turn on and off the lights, Stereo, TV, Air Conditioner, and any other home appliance powered by 220/110V





-----------------------------
I recently competed in International Embedded systems design competition called EMECS-thon and I won public's choice award.
The project was about generating midi sound on floopy drives.
It consisted of: JAVA application, microcontroller and floppy drives.

------------------------------------------------------------------
and I started learning Java programming language.
Since then I gained a lot more experience in Java and its features by 
attending University courses and self studying. 
I learned a lot about Algorithms, Java Design-patterns, Data structures,
Java networking, Java multithreading and Swing API. 
Some of these skills I gained by developing Multithreaded Chat application.
